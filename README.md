## What We Will Implement:
An event scheduling application using the MERN stack. In this application, you will be able to create an account and schedule your events.

The languages we are going to use are:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## How to Compile and Run:

To compile and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Code**: You can download the repository in two ways:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine by typing the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Kiopp/Event-Scheduling-Application.git
     ```
   - Download the ZIP file for the application by clicking "Download ZIP" from the GitHub repository:  
     ![Download ZIP](https://github.com/Kiopp/Event-Scheduling-Application/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Open Two Terminals**:
   - One for the backend:
     - Navigate to the backend directory of the application (typically `Event-Scheduling-Application/backend`) in your terminal.
     - Run the following commands:
       ```bash
       npm install
       npm start
       ```

   - One for the frontend:
     - Navigate to the frontend directory of the application (typically `Event-Scheduling-Application/event-app`) in another terminal.
     - Run the following commands:
       ```bash
       npm install
       npm start
       ```

4. **Access the Application**: Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. If you are not redirected to the application automatically, enter the URL manually.
